# Tradeworthy CRM
A simple OOP PHP CRM where you can interact with clients and log information about them, as well as allowing a user to sign up and post a job that they need doing, which can then have quotes added to it.

## Running the project locally
As this is a PHP project, that is reliant on a database it cannot be used locally, I am working on getting it hosted at the moment.

## Built With
- PHP
- OOP PHP

## VCS
I use GIT for my version control, as well as utilising elements of the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow, such as having a dev, staging and master branch, as well as using feature branches to properly test new features.
